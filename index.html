				PEMF is not a new technology; it has been researched and verified by hundreds of 
				<a style="color:#42C2CA;" target="_blank" href="http://sandbox-pulse2.afamilyfriendgroup.org/thetechnology.php#articles">studies</a>		
				by numerous doctors and researchers, so when we say PEMF is safe, effective, and has no risk of over-use, you don’t have to just take our word for it.
				<br><br> PEMF technology has been limited to use by doctors with large, expensive equipment; but not anymore!
				<br>
				Stamped with IEC 60601-1 Approval (Medical Electric Equipment requirement for basic safety and essential performance), you can use eroPulse at home knowing you’re getting safe and effective PEMF treatment.
			</div>
	
			<div id="desc2" class="featuresdesc" >
				You used to have to visit a doctor to be treated with PEMF, but today, the same treatment is controlled by a remote that resembles the size and design of the smartphones we already carry on a daily basis.  This makes  it easy to heal throughout the day, even while doing chores, at work, or even at night while you sleep. The more you use it, the better the results will be.
			</div>
		
			<div id="desc3" class="featuresdesc"> 
				eroPulse is not only non-addictive, it is completely safe, and poses no risk of overdose. Can you imagine life without daily pain pills or unpleasant side-effects?  With eroPulse, the more you use it, the more effective it will be.  Healing and health are an ongoing process, so use frequently without fear of overuse!
			</div> 
		
			<div id="desc4"  class="featuresdesc" >
			eroPulse is a healing device, meaning it treats you for the long- run, unlike most medication, which is often a temporary fix- especially for common, recurring aches and pains. But, this also means that it takes time to feel the benefits. Be patient as your body begins to heal with regular PEMF treatment with eroPulse. Most will begin to feel a change within a few days to a week if used for at least one full 4-hour treatment period each day.
			</div> 
			
			<div id="desc5" class="featuresdesc"> 
			EroPulse takes the same technology used in the expensive machines used by doctors and transforms it into a device that is affordable, accessible and available to anyone. eroPulse was developed to innovate pain relief methods while democratizing better health, so creating an affordable product is a key foundation

	<div class="section" id="section2">
		<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
			<p>eroPulse heals at the cellular level by removing cellular waste more efficiently and bringing in more nutrients the cell needs for faster healing and provides better blood flow. eroPulse is healing at the cellular level not blocking the pain like medicines and other treatments do.

		<h1>Where Can I Place eroPulse?</h1>
		<p>EroPulse can be used anywhere on the body. The Technology has been proven to provide effective pain relief from muscle pain, joint discomforts and nerve pain. Just place the energy pad to the area of the pain with any method (elastic braces, socks for foot, etc) and let the healing begin.

		<div class="mediaText">
			<div></div>
			<p><em>Mobile and Comfortable to Wear:</em> with the wearable technology similar to the size of the smartphones, you can take the healing technology anywhere and anytime; while working, watching TV, running errands, and sleeping without feeling any uncomfortable sensation.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="mediaText">
			<div></div>
			<p><em>Cellular Healing:</em> eroPulse is pain management device that heals at cellular level not an inhibitor that just blocks the pain signal from the reaching the brain, like pain medications. eroPulse’s healing technology takes time but it resolves your root cause of pain, cell damage. Be patient as your body begins to heal from this amazing technology. Most will begin to notice the difference within few days to couple weeks. The longer you use the healing technology, the faster it will heal.</p>

			<p><em>Affordable and Safe to Use:</em> eroPulse was created to provide this healing technology to everyone. We utilize the same technology used by the smartphone industry to make the eroPulse affordable, accessible, and available to everyone. With IEC 60601-1 test certificate (Medical electrical equipment, general requirements for basic safety and essential performance) you can be assured that the eroPulse is safe to use with no risks of overdosing like with other traditional medicines.</p>

	<h1>The History</h1>
	<p>Despite widespread acceptance of Pulsed Electromagnetic Field technology all over Europe and Asia, it continues to slip under the radar. The pharmaceutical industry dominates the pain management sector of healthcare here, and much of the population is skeptical of a treatment plan that requires no medication. Simply put, it seems too good to be true.</p>
	<p>However, in parts of Europe and Asia, PEMF and similar therapies are already being offered on a daily basis and successfully address a wide array of ailments.</p>
	<p>Yet in the US, the accepted way to receive treatment is to book an expensive appointment in a hospital or doctor’s office. eroPulse eliminates this inconvenience and offers the same technology to you in the comfort of your own home. Help us democratize health, making sure this natural and proven aid to eliminating pain and healing the body, is as widely available as possible.</p>
	<div class="mediaText">
	<div></div>
	<p>Driven by the ambition to share PEMF technology with the world, Sam founded Pulse Therapeutic as the first step in disseminating PEMF technology to the public. His success with six medical start-ups has given him the tools to conceptualize and develop eroPulse, a PEMF device for daily life.</p>

<!-- Section11 (FAQs) -->
	<div class="section" id="section11">
	<h1>FAQs</h1>
		<h4 class="faq_header1">Q: How often should I use eroPulse?</h4>
		<p class="faq_paragraph1">We recommend daily treatment for at least couple of hours, either 
		during the day, overnight or both.  The longer you use eroPulse, the faster you will feel the relief.</p>

		<h4 class="faq_header2">Q: Can I overdose? Are there side effects? Is it addictive?</h4>
		<p class="faq_paragraph2">No. The body is already electric and PEMF therapy simply produces 
		additional energy in the body to help it heal faster. No harmful chemicals are pushed into the body. 
		The body cannot overdose as only damaged, injured or unhealthy areas use the extra energy to repair and regenerate.</p>

		<h4 class="faq_header3">Q: Will I feel pain during therapy?</h4>
		<p class="faq_paragraph3">  No pain! If you feel pain-free pulsing from PEMF, start with 
		Low strength and gradually increase to High. Or, do therapy in sets of 30 minutes to an hour throughout the day.</p>

		<h4 class="faq_header4">Q: How quickly will my illness or health issue heal?</h4>
		<p class="faq_paragraph4">  It varies on the extent of your health problem and how often 
		you use eroPulse. Cells with minor damage can be quickly repaired before an issue worsens and becomes 
		obvious. If you wait until you have significant health issues, the cells may be too damaged 
		for PEMF to produce the desired results or may take longer to heal. However, with daily PEMF and 
		your body’s natural healing timelines and processes, your body will heal damaged cells gradually. 
		It takes patience, acceptance and daily use of eroPulse to see results. PEMF therapy does not 
		cure diseases, instead it improves bodily functions so that it can better support and heal itself.</p>
